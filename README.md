# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C, which help demonstrate core concepts of algorithms and efficient data handling.

## Repository Structure


- **Arrays**: Implementations and operations on arrays.
- **LinkedList**: Implementations for singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack**: Stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queue**: Queue operations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Tree data structures like binary trees and binary search trees.
- **Graphs**: Graph representations and operations.
